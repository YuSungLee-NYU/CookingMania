    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
        The background colored by black for space mood but it's only temporal decision. <br>
        There are four different customers with random orders.<br>
        Each customer can either be kicked out or be served. <br>
        If the user clikc the customer, the customer will let the user know what to make.<br>
        Decided to delete HUD for now for better graphic.<br><br>

    <h2>Progress</h2>
    <p>

        Finding working 3d objects was challenging. <br>
        Couldn't figure out how to manage the font size of text holder. <br>
        Isntead of removing each object, the custmoer will be placed at below the <br>ground and every time I need one of them, using setY(), I lifted up. <br>
        There's a invisible plane which is hitbox of customer, which allows the user to figure out what they want. <br>
        The speech bubble, or dialogue box is not made yet but it will be displayed and help the user know what to cook. <br>
